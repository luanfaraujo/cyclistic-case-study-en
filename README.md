## Abstract

This study analyzes yearly Divvy bike-share data (June 2024 to May 2025) to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members. The goal is to develop targeted marketing strategies to convert casual users into members, increasing long-term revenue. Our findings reveal that casual riders primarily use bikes for leisure and tourism on weekends, while members use them for daily commuting. Based on these insights, three data-driven recommendations are proposed.

## How to access

- **Detailed view:** If you want to see the detailing of my process - involving the organization of the dataframes, cleaning process, codes written and used, results, and suggestions - download *bikeshare_jup.html* and run it on your browser.
- **Slides:** If you prefer a summarized version of this case study, focusing on visualizations, results, and suggestions, download *bike_share_presentation-en.pptx* and run it on your slide presentation software (PowerPoint, Google Slides). I **strongly** recommend using the presentation mode, as the slides have animations that, in preview mode, hide some relevant information.
